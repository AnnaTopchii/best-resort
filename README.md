# Hotel Website Project

This project is a hotel website built using React. It utilizes React Router DOM for routing and is designed to be responsive for four different screen sizes: 360 pixels, 768 pixels, 1440 pixels, and 1920 pixels.

Upon loading the website, users will see a splash screen that disappears upon their first scroll. At the bottom of the main page, there is navigation to the most important sections of the website. The menu is implemented as a burger menu, and social media links are provided as icons.
